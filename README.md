Android App
The repository contains the .java and .xml files to run an application which connects with a arduino modem using bluetooth.
The project was to synchronise an application with a device which is mounted on a two wheeler driver's helmet.The android application is made inorder to save contacts which will be immediately called if the driver meets an accident .This receives signal from the device and sends automatically emergency messages to all users when certain force is observed.

To run this app on desktop copy all java files (without .xml extension) to src file in a new project on Eclipse.
Now copy the .xml file to layout folder of the same project.
Dry run the project.There shouldnt be any errors but if there are please leave a mail to mayankdawar1@gmail.com.
